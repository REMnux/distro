 .B cat [<page ranges>]
 Assembles (catenates) pages from input PDFs to create a new PDF. Use \fBcat\fR to merge PDF pages or to split PDF pages from documents. You can also use it to rotate PDF pages. Page order in the new PDF is specified by the order of the given page ranges. Page ranges are described like this:

 .B shuffle [<page ranges>]
 Collates pages from input PDFs to create a new PDF.  Works like the \fBcat\fR operation except that it takes one page at a time from each page range to assemble the output PDF.  If one range runs out of pages, it continues with the remaining ranges.  Ranges can use all of the features described above for \fBcat\fR, like reverse page ranges, multiple ranges from a single PDF, and page rotation.  This feature was designed to help collate PDF pages after scanning paper documents.
